# DeRegNet - Find deregulated subnetworks

## Introduction

One of the main challenges of high-throuput omics technologies 
(genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) is the 
interpretation and analysis of the resulting datasets in terms
of known or previously unknown biologial processes. Biological networks
(transcriptional regulatory networks, signaling networks, metabolic
network, etc.) provide promising scaffolds for approaching
multi-omics datasets. Existing resources, constructed for
example from pathway databases like KEGG, Reactome, etc., provide
extensive interconnected networks linking genes, proteins and other
biological agents by various kinds of interactions like generic
activation or inhibition, transcriptional suppression or postranscriptional
modifications like posphorylation. DeRegNet allows the extraction and
prioritisation of subnetworks of larger biomolecular networks based on
suitable omics data like for example gene expression.

## Run via Docker 

Using deregnet via Docker is the only officially supported and documented way of running deregnet. See [examples here](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/tree/master/examples).

In any case, you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

### Gurobi floating license

In case of a Gurobi [token server / floating license](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/quickstart_linux/creating_a_token_server_cl.html#subsection:clientlicensetoken) you need to make your license file known to the deregnet 
Docker container. Do this by

```sh
export GUROBI_LICENSE=<path to your license file>
```
before running deregnet.

By default the license file will be expected in *~/.licenses/gurobi*.
You need to make sure that the license server configured in your license is reachable from Docker containers
running on your host.

Once the license is configured, the best way to run deregnet is via [*docker/token-server/run*](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/tree/master/docker/token-server) script:

```sh
docker/token-server/run <DEREGNET_IMAGE> <CMD>
```
See below for further information about the \<DEREGNET_IMAGE\> and \<CMD\> placeholders.

### Setup for use with a Gurobi named-user license

In case of a Gurobi [named user academic license](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/quickstart_linux/creating_a_new_academic_li.html#subsection:createacademiclicense) you also need to make your license file known to the deregnet 
Docker container. Do this by

```sh
export GUROBI_LICENSE=<path to your license file>
```
before running deregnet.

By default the license file will be expected in *~/.licenses/gurobi*.

In order to make a named user license work for deregnet, one additional step is to find the MAC address with respect to which your license
is registered. Do the following before running deregnet:

```
export MAC_ADDRESS_FOR_GUROBI_DOCKER=<YOUR-MAC-ADDRESS>
```

Finding your right \<YOUR-MAC-ADDRESS\> is system-specific, in case of doubt, try all MAC addresses listed by *ifconfig -a* and proceed by trial and error until
your license is accepted while running deregnet (see below).

Once the license is configured, the best way to run deregnet is via [*docker/named-user/run*](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/tree/master/docker/named-user) script:

```sh
docker/named-user/run <DEREGNET_IMAGE> <CMD>
```
See below for further information about the \<DEREGNET_IMAGE\> and \<CMD\> placeholders.

### \<DEREGNET_IMAGE\>

Deregnet Docker images are available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sebwink/deregnet) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/packages). Usually, you should be able to just run:

```sh
docker/token-server/run sebwink/deregnet:latest <CMD>
```

To run a specific release of deregnet run for example:


```sh
docker/token-server/run sebwink/deregnet:0.99.999 <CMD>
```

The best way to run with a specific [supported](https://github.com/sebwink/gurobi-docker/blob/master/GUROBI_VERSIONS) Gurobi version is for example like so:


```sh
docker/token-server/run sebwink/deregnet-grb9.0.2:0.99.999 <CMD>
```

```sh
docker/token-server/run sebwink/deregnet-grb8.1.1:latest <CMD>
```

### \<CMD\>
  
deregnet Docker images support multiple commands. The most straight-forward one is to [use](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/tree/master/examples/command-line) the main script for deregnet:

```sh
docker/named-user/run sebwink/deregnet:latest avgdrgnt.py --help
```

```sh

For example:

docker/name-user/run sebwink/deregnet:latest avgdrgnt.py \
  --graph test/kegg_hsa.graphml \
  --scores test/data/score.csv \
  --sep , \
  --graph-id-attr ensembl
``` 

Other commands include *drgnt.py* (Optimization for absolute, not average, best subgraphs).

The most frequent other use cases are to run [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/tree/master/examples/jupyterlab) or custom [Python scripts](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/tree/master/examples/custom-python-script).

### [Examples](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/tree/master/examples)

### Input-output via Docker volumes

Generally your current working directory will be mounted in the running Docker containers. Also some Docker-necessitated access right and owner
sanitations will be carried out, [see for example](https://github.com/sebwink/deregnet/blob/master/docker/named-user/run).

### Security considerations

Only run the deregnet images in trusted environments.
